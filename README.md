## Inspiration

Everyone deserves to feel safe online. But, for better or worse, everything is out there on the internet, including harmful content. **Warn** helps users take control over their well-being by filtering out content that could reawaken trauma. 

## What it does
**Warn** is a browser extension that helps users pick what they want to see on the internet. It currently supports six common triggers that often appear in media: adult content, hate, gambling, substance abuse, visually disturbing content, and violence. When a user loads a webpage, **Warn** checks it for sensitive media, then blocks it out if it's present, without affecting the rest of the page's content. Currently, **Warn** blocks triggering photos, audio, and video.

## How we built it
**Warn** is a Chrome extension, written in pure JavaScript. It is supported by a RESTful API writtent in Python Flask and powered by the AssemblyAI API and AWS Rekognition.
