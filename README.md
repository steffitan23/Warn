## Inspiration

Everyone deserves to feel safe online. But, for better or worse, everything is out there on the internet, including harmful content. **Warn** helps users take control over their well-being by filtering out content that could reawaken trauma. 

## What it does
**Warn** is a browser extension that helps users pick what they want to see on the internet. It currently supports six common triggers that often appear in media all over the internet: adult content, hate, gambling, substance abuse, visually disturbing content, and violence.
